# Business Model

## How We Make Money (Simple)

We charge a small fee on each campaign. Lower than traditional platforms because automation reduces costs.

**Core principle:** Sustainable fees that benefit all parties, not maximum extraction.

---

## Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue: Campaign Fees

**How it works:**
- Project creates campaign with budget
- We charge fee (around 10-15%)
- Influencer receives remainder
- Fee covers platform operation

**Example:**
- Campaign budget: $5,000
- Platform fee (12%): $600
- Influencer receives: $4,400

**Why this works:**
- Projects get verified influencers
- Influencers get payment protection
- Platform sustainable at scale

### Why Fees Are Lower

**Traditional platforms:** 20-50% fees
**Our platform:** 10-15% fees

**How we keep fees low:**

**1. Automation Reduces Costs**
- Verification automated (not manual review)
- Payments automated (not manual processing)
- Matching automated (not human coordination)
- Disputes minimized (clear agreements)

**2. Volume Over Margins**
- Lower fees = more users
- More users = more campaigns
- More campaigns = sustainable revenue
- Focus on long-term growth

**3. No Legacy Cost Structure**
- No physical offices required
- No large manual workforce
- No traditional corporate overhead
- Lean operation from day one

**4. Technology Stack**
- Modern, efficient infrastructure
- Cloud-based scaling
- Automated workflows
- Minimal operational costs
