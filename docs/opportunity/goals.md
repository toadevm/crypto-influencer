## Questions to Ask Us

### Healthy Skepticism Welcome

**Good questions investors should ask:**

- "What's your biggest concern about this model?"
- "What would make you shut this down?"
- "How will you know if it's working?"
- "What's your burn rate plan?"
- "When will you know about product-market fit?"
- "What's the most likely failure mode?"

**We encourage critical thinking.** If you're not somewhat skeptical, you're not paying attention.
